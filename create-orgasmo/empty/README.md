This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [orgasmo](https://github.com/hacknlove/orgasmoproject) project bootstrapped with [`create-orgasmo`](https://github.com/hacknlove/orgasmoproject/tree/main/create-orgasmo).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Take a look around, and read the readmes.

Also, this is a Next.js web app, so you still have all the Next.js' features.
