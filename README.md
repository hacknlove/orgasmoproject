Orgasmo is a more a set of components and tools for developers that enhances Nextjs to help you build outstanding web apps, with the following characteristics.

### How to make a PO orgasm? 

* **Lighter pages**, and faster first load time, without sacrificing content or interactivity, thanks to the Orgasmo's **lazy stream of data and components** that provides you out of the box with smart infinite vertical scroll, and horizontal sliders. 
* **Huge no-code flexibility** that allows faster changes and provides more agility and shorter iteration loops, thanks to the Orgasmo's **dynamic site structure**, that avoid deploys and their overhead.  Developers only components and drivers, what component go where and when, and which what data is not code is data.
* **Safest changes** with a minimized Impact on case of error, thanks to the Orgasmo's **progressive  propagation**, that makes it possible to deliver the newest version to a growing subset  of your visitors.
* and many, many more like **AB testing**, **role-based permissions**, or **smart caching**.

### How to make a developer orgasm? 
* **100% Bullshit free**: No boilerplate code, no weird esoteric magic, no complex configuration. The quickest quick start you have ever seen.
* **Incrementally adoptable**: This is not a take-it-all-or-leave-it-all framework.  Everything is designed to work and be useful alone and together. Just pick the piece you need now, and use it now within your current Nextjs application. 
* **Fully decoupled**: easily create multiple drivers for different backends or scenarios, and switch between them easily. You could for instance have different mocked driver for your development or tests environments.
* and many, many more nice things like, **type-safe**, **fully tested** or **DDD ready**
