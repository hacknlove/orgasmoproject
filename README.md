## The best UX ever

Orgasmo's goal is to make it easy for you to improve your users' experience, by giving you the best work experience and a complete set of over-the-top features. 

## The Vision.

**It should not be necessary to edit the code to change the order of two components in a page**.

* Code is for: Components, Drivers and permanent styling.
* Data is for: Content, Structure and ephemeral styling.

### The Solution.

Orgasmo is a plugin for Next.js that makes this vision possible.

You will have all the Next.js' benefits, and also you will enable your marketing team to:

* Change any content they want, including labels, on their own, without bothering you.
* Change what components are shown in any page and in which order, on their own, without bothering you.
* Add new routes and pages using and combining the existing components, on their own, without bothering you.
* Create testing versions of any page to try their changes, and when they are happy with the changes, apply them back to the production page, on their own, without bothering you.
* Set up progressive delivery strategies to gradually roll out their changes to limit any potential negative impact, on their own, without bothering you.
* Show different pages or content to different users based on their geographical localization or any cookie or HTTP header, on their own, without bothering you.
* Add as many contents as you want to any page without any performance penalty at all, on their own, without bothering you.
* Set up role-based rules to show different content to different roles, on their own, without bothering you.

But that's not all. Orgasmo also has nice gifts for you:

* It provides you with a DDD-ready architecture. Everything is intended to be greatly decoupled because at the end you don't know (or care) how the marketing team is going to use it.
* You can adopt it incrementally. This is not a take-it-all-or-leave-it-all framework. Just pick the pieces you need now and use it now, within your current Next.js application.
* The ability to write and use different drivers for different scenarios, for instance a mocked driver to developing new features or to run tests.
* A notable reduction of bullshit and boilerplate code.

### The waiting...

Good things come to those who wait.

You could start using this now, just do
```
npm init orgasmo your-project-name
```

But I've decided to discourage any early use by not documenting anything, until I've used it in a production site, and I'm 100% sure it's production ready. 

I want to feel free to do any breaking changes at any time without any concern or remorse.

If you are interested, please **watch** and **star** the project up there in the right, so I know there are people waiting.

Thanks.
