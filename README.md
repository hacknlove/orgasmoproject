## The best UX, the best DX, the best MX (marketeer experience).

Orgasmo's goal is to make it easy for you to improve your users' experience, by giving you the best developer experience, the best marketeer experience, and a complete set of over-the-top features. 

## The Context.

Writing code is expensive and slow. You can improve it cost and speed, but it will never be as cheap and fast as editing data.

Any web application in any highly competitive market requires increasingly shorter iteration cycles to run experiments, collect data, and thus optimize user acquisition and retention.

But they also required to have very specific and unique features that set it apart from the competition.

Summarizing, a web application needs to have very specialized functionalities and to be easily and quickly modifiable.

But it's very hard to have both things.

Either you use a CMS to configure an easily and quickly modifiable website, or you use a framweork to tailor a custom webapp.

**Till now.**

## The vision.

* Code is for: Components, Drivers and CSS rules.
* Data is for: Content, Structure and CSS variables.

### The Solution.

Orgasmo is a plugin for Next.js that makes this vision possible.

You will have all the Next.js' benefits, and also you will enable your marketing team to:

* Change any content they want, including labels, on their own, without bothering you.
* Change what components are shown in any page and in which order, on their own, without bothering you.
* Add new routes and pages using and combining the existing components, on their own, without bothering you.
* Create testing versions of any page to try their changes, and when they are happy with the changes, apply them back to the production page, on their own, without bothering you.
* Set up progressive delivery strategies to gradually roll out their changes to limit any potential negative impact, on their own, without bothering you.
* Show different pages or content to different users based on their geographical localization or any cookie or HTTP header, on their own, without bothering you.
* Add as many contents as you want to any page without any performance penalty at all, on their own, without bothering you.
* Set up role-based rules to show different content to different roles, on their own, without bothering you.

But that's not all. Orgasmo also has nice gifts for you:

* You still have full freedom to organize your code and your data schema as it suits you better.
* It provides you with a DDD-ready architecture. Everything is intended to be greatly decoupled because at the end you don't know (or care) how the marketing team is going to use it.
* You can adopt it incrementally. This is not a take-it-all-or-leave-it-all framework. Just pick the pieces you need now and use it now, within your current Next.js application.
* The ability to write and use different drivers for different scenarios, for instance a mocked driver to developing new features or to run tests.
* A notable reduction of bullshit and boilerplate code.

### The waiting...

Good things come to those who wait.

If you are interested in this project, please **watch it** and **star it**, up there in the right, so I know there are people waiting.

Thanks.

### The helping...

Even better things come to those who help.

I cannot do this alone.

There are many things that I am aware that I am not good at, but the things that worries me more are those other things that I am missing and I am not even aware of it.
