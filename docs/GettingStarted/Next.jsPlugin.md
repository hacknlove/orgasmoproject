# Next.js plugin

Orgasmo is a plugin for next.js that enhances it without removing or modifying any of its features or characteristics that we love, and we rely on.

- You can [add the plugin to any existent Next.js application](Advanced/ManualInstallation), and it will work the same as before, plus you will be able to create fully dynamic pages for which the content and the structure (what Components to use) comes from your data-sources.
- You also can [create an orgasmo application from scratch](GettingStarted/Installation.md), and you'll have an orgasmo's version of the Next.js scaffolding app.
- If you are new to Next.js, please visit [https://nextjs.org/docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) before continuing.
