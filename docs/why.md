# Orgasmo

## Why?

Two kinds of logic/ code/ features:
* Business related
* Generic

The less time we waste writing and maintaining generic stuff, the more time we can invest in writing and maintaining outstanding business stuff.

## What Orgasmo brings to the table.

* Great performance
* A outstanding set of generic features.
* Great DX
* Fastest iterations

### Great Performance

* smart caching
* Lazy loading of both js components and its data

### Generic Features

* AB testing
* Progressive delivery
* Role Based Access
* Label Based Access (country, device, cookies, custom headers, language, etc.)
* Feature Flagging
* etc.

And it's also a place where I can add more generic features, without polluting or business code

### Great DX

* Playground
* stories for free
* mocking data source
* no glue-code, no bloated shit
* monorepo ready

* deployments without risk*
* easy to spin off experiments, even on production

* The imagination is the limit.

### Fastest Iterations

* No deploy needed for non-functional changes.

----------------

# Risks: Fight or Flight.

* Not mature
* Not stable yet
* Unknown territory, unknown pitfalls
* Very low bus factor

## Fight. (Success with pain points)

We can improve Orgasmo.

## Flight. (Mostly a failure)

It's very easy to opt out:

* Incrementally
* Pure nextjs app. Just lost some of the cool features.
* Hybrid, replacing orgasmo pieces by in house code, to keep some of the cool features.
